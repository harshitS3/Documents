   - **What**: Automate testing and deployment of code.  
   - **When/How**: After push to GitHub, trigger builds, tests, and production deployment (e.g., via Jenkins or GitHub Actions).

2. **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**  
   - **What**: Define infrastructure in code (e.g., Terraform).  
   - **When/How**: Reusable, version-controlled cloud infrastructure setups.

3. **DORA (DevOps Research & Assessment)**  
   - **What**: Research on DevOps metrics (e.g., deployment frequency, MTTR).  
   - **When/How**: Use to measure DevOps maturity.

4. **SLI/SLO/SLA**  
   - **SLI**: What you measure (e.g., uptime).  
   - **SLO**: Your target (e.g., 99.9% uptime).  
   - **SLA**: The legal agreement with clients.
